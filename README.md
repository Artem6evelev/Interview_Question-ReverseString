# Interview_Question-ReverseString_Day_2
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.  
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.
